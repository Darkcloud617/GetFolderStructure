# GetFolderStructure
Read windows folder structure and write to a CSV.

- Update pathing and name in hardcode. 

1. Once pointed at a directory it will write to a CSV on a local device. Allowing for easy views of the entire structure.
2. If needed, a comparison tool will write the differences in two folder structures to a CSV as well.
